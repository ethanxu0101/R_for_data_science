## 20.3 Important Types of atomic vector

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


### 1. Describe the difference between `is.finite(x`) and `!is.infinite(x)`

Ans: To find out, try the functions on a numeric vector that includes at least one number and the four special values `(NA, NaN, Inf, -Inf)`.

```{r}
x <- c(0, NA, NaN, Inf, -Inf)
is.finite(x)

!is.infinite(x)  ## infinite only considers Inf and -Inf as True
```

### 5. What functions from the readr package allow you to turn a string into logical, integer, and double vector?

Ans: `parse_logical`, `parse_integer`, `parse_number`
