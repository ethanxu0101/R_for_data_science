```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Read `flavors_of_cacao` data: 
```{r}
chocolatedata <- read_csv("data/flavors_of_cacao.csv")

```

Some of our column names have space in them. This line changes the column names to versions without spaces (replace it by `.`), which let's us talk about the columns by their names.
```{r}
names(chocolatedata) <- make.names(names(chocolatedata), unique=TRUE)
```

Read another dataset: `food_coded.csv`

```{r}
# food_preferences <- read_csv("data/food_coded.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
```

```{r}

```
