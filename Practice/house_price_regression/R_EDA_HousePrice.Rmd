```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Read csv file and save it into `house_price_df`

```{r}
house_price_df <- read_csv('train.csv')
```

Investigate the distribution of house price `SalePrice` by plotting

```{r}
summary(house_price_df$SalePrice)
```


```{r}
ggplot(data=house_price_df, aes(SalePrice)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins=30)
```
```{r}

ggplot(data=house_price_df, aes(SalePrice)) + 
  geom_freqpoly()

```
2. Once we determine the target, we can then pick up serveral features to investigate the relationship between them. (use scatter plot for numeric values and box plots for categorical features)

For example, we can select `GrLivArea`, `TotalBsmtSF`, `OverallQual` `YearBuilt`

```{r}
ggplot(data=house_price_df, aes(x=GrLivArea, y=SalePrice)) + geom_point()
```
